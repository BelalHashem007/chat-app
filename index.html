      content="Developed a responsive real-time chat web application using React and Firebase, focused on secure authentication and seamless user communication. The application supports email/password authentication as well as guest access, enabling users to start conversations quickly.

Real-time one-to-one and group messaging is powered by Firebase Firestore observers, with online/offline presence tracking implemented using Firebase Realtime Database. Users can add contacts via email or guest ID, search and filter conversations by name, and manage basic profile details.

The project emphasizes reliability and maintainability through comprehensive UI testing and properly configured Firebase security rules. The application is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices."
